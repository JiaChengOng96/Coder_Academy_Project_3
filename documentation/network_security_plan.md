Context
This task will require you to generate a written network security plan based on your own research of security documentation, government policies, and any other resource material available on risk management, assessment and network security planning. The task is based primarily on a Problem Scenario around which the tasks revolve. You will be required to analyse the problem scenario and information you research and apply this to the problem scenario.

You will have the opportunity to seek feedback from your trainer or an industry specialist as part of this task - you must be prepared to engage with them in a formal way as if you were speaking to prospective client as a security professional.

It is strongly recommended that you read all of the items in the suggested reading which can be found in the Appendix, and conduct your own research into information security best practices.

Decision Making Rules

Satisfy the word length requirements for each sub-task
Refer to the Problem Scenario as the basis for answering all questions
Problem Scenario
You are a security consultant who has been asked to develop a network security plan for a client who is a tech obsessive/early-adopter. The client has a high speed internet connection and both a wired and wireless network which connects many different devices throughout their home.

Contextual Details
The client works in the finance sector as a senior executive and lives with their partner and two children. The dwelling is a house which has a backyard with a back fence that adjoins a public park. The distance from the dwelling to the back fence is approximately 20 metres.

The power source and internet connection for the dwelling comes from overhead powerlines at the front of the house. There is no backup source of power. The wifi router is located on the kitchen bench. The home has a basic alarm system with motion detectors, but does not have phone home capability to a response company.

Technical Details
Router: TP-LINK AC750

Wifi-range extenders: N/A, extended antenna attached to router with range well onto the street frontage and park.

Network Attached Storage: Apple time machine.

Mobile Devices: 2 x Samsung Galaxy S8 Android phones, 1 x iPhone 7, 1 x iPhone X

Computers: 2 x 2014 HP standard laptops running Windows 8.1, 2 x 2017 Macbook Pros

Home Security System: basic alarm system with motion detectors, and two Grandstream products, note: imagine you have visited the client's home, visit the Grandstream website and pick TWO network connected security products other than motion detectors that the client is using.

IoT: Smart fridge, Google Home, baby monitor, remote access to security camera monitoring front door via web GUI

Instructions
You must write a network security plan to present to the client:

Identify threats to network security by creating a threat model for the network described in the Problem Scenario. You must:

outline the common and emerging vulnerabilities for the client (150 - 200 words)


profile TWO potential attackers, and describe: (200 - 300 words for each profile)

Random hacker
- 

Physical burglar
 - Motivation: Burglar are only interest in robbing valuable items may or may not specific target for example like gold, jewellery and other else
 - Scenario: Burglar may be armed with various type of weapon or without anything. Assume that the whole family are not at home, the burglar would need to cut the only power supply which supply the power and would then disable the only basic alarm system installed. He can then enter through their backdoor and start stealing valuable stuff. In this case we say that there is only one burglar, so the amount of stuff he can carry is limited which he focus more on easy money stuff like gold bar or jewellery or even try pick lock the safe(If there is a safe) 
- Technical expertise: To rob a house would required less to no technical skill. However in our scenario there is a basic alarm system with motion detection. So one of the skill needed is to disable the motion detector or cut the power supply. Other than that he may need some simple lock picking skill to unlock the door or he can just brute force the door in a way that no one would notice it. When stealing stuff would required no technical skill but if there is a safe with lock on it, it would required high technical skill to open the lock.
- Severity: This attack can be consider medium to severe because the burglar can be armed and harm the household member


the attacker's motivations in attacking the network and the relationship the attacker may have with the client
a particular scenario or threat the attacker could pose
the technical expertise required for them to carry out the attack
the possible severity/seriousness of the attack and the damage it could cause

categorise the threats/issues you have identified and provide a statement which gives them an overall qualitative assessment of their security posture. (150 - 200 words)

Analyse the security risks and outline the process of risk management, you must:
outline the risk management process you will undertake to assess risks in plain-English. (200 - 300 words)

identify and categorise THREE potentially valuable assets on the network, you must (400 - 500 words):

identify the type of asset and state why it is valuable

determine and record the value of each asset to:

the client
the attacker
in monetary terms
indicate whether this asset requires protection from attack
Create a risk management plan and security controls based on your threat model and assets on the network, you must:
design two policies which outline security controls and requirements to mitigate TWO threats in your threat model. (300 - 400 words per policy)
create a timeline and budget for the implementation of policies (200 - 300 words)
write a plain-English explanation for the client relating to the timeline and budget for implementation of the risk management plan (150 - 200 words)
create a process for continuous review in the form of a list of steps to be followed to maintain the security controls you have designed (100 - 200 words)
provide evidence you have received feedback from a industry expert on your risk management plan, and how you have modified your approach based on feedback (notes on feedback or written feedback from industry expert in addition to 100 - 200 words on your response to this feedback)
Design an auditing and incident response plan to handle a security incident affecting the network described in the Problem Scenario

Your Incident response plan must include:

a description of the incident it will address (150 - 200 words)

an outline which states how it provides appropriate coverage for the incident which must refer to an authoritative source on incident response (100 - 200 words)

create an auditing checklist with FIVE items which includes:

software and hardware configurations to be checked which support security controls and incident response procedures
suggested penetration tests that should be conducted to verify security controls are in place to prevent the incident
create a process, a list of steps, that should be followed should the incident occur, the process must include (200 - 300 words):

A preamble which has an allocation of responsibilities to relevant persons
specific details relating to the management, monitoring and auditing of software and hardware in the context of the incident
